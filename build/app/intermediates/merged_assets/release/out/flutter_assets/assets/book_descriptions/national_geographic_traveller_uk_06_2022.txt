The June issue of National Geographic Traveller (UK) is out now. The cover story this month focuses on Scandinavia — Denmark, Norway and Sweden — where nature throws out the rulebook. Shaped by the elements and ruled by the seasons, this is a region not only bound by cultural ties, but by a love for epic outdoor adventures. From oyster safaris on Denmark’s dramatic shoreline and wilderness camping in Norwegian national parks to learning about Sámi culture in Swedish Lapland, these are the ultimate Scandinavian experiences.
